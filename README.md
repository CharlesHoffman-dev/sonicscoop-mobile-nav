# SonicScoop's Mobile Navigation Menu
The CSS file, JS file, and single image are linked to the index.html file.

FontAwesome has been included within the assets folder for reference but I believe this library is already available on SonicScoop's website.

Feel free to style the menu however you want. The search bar works and all the functionality is there.

This nav menu will only appear when the viewfinder width is smaller than or equal to 680px.
