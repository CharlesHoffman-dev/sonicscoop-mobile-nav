# SonicScoop's Mobile Navigation Menu
The CSS file, JS file, and single image are linked to the index.html file.

There's a FontAwesome icon within the search bar that should appear when you embed this code within the site. I didn't bother adding FontAwesome to the index.html file.

If you want, you can embed a FontAwesome arrow next to the menu items with dropdown content.

Feel free to style the menu however you want. The search bar works and all the functionality is there.

This nav menu will only appear when the viewfinder width is smaller than or equal to 680px.
