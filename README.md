# SonicScoop's Mobile Navigation Menu
The CSS file, JS file, and single image are linked to the index.html file.

There's a FontAwesome icon within the search bar that should appear when you embed this code within the site. I didn't bother adding FontAwesome to the index.html file.

If you want, you can embed a FontAwesome arrow next to the menu items with dropdown content.

Feel free to style the menu however you want. The search bar works and all the functionality is there.
